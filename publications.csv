In this study, we assess the public and private costs and benefits of distributed desalination in the Central Valley (CV) of California. We employ environmental and economic modeling to estimate the value of reducing the salinity of irrigation water; the value of augmenting water supply under present and future climate scenarios; and the human health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with generating power to desalinate water. We find that water desalination is only likely to be profitable in 4% of the CV during periods of severe drought, and that current costs would need to decrease by 70–90% for adoption to occur on the median acre. Fossil-fuel powered desalination technologies also generate air emissions that impose significant public costs in the form of human health and climate change damages, although these damages vary greatly depending on technology. The ecosystem service benefits of reduced agricultural drainage would need to be valued between $800 and $1200 per acre-foot, or nearly the full capital and operational costs of water desalination, for the net benefits of water desalination to be positive from a societal perspective.",December 2017,modeling;agriculture;management

Ecological data and studies for the region are also limited, making informed conservation in agricultural landscapes difficult. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data provide opportunities to relate species occurrences to measures of landscape heterogeneity even when field measures of habitat structure are lacking. When working with such remotely sensed data, it’s important to select appropriate measures of heterogeneity, including common metrics of landscape composition as well as frequently overlooked shape metrics. In this contribution we combine bird surveys with multispectral satellite imagery to develop boosted regression tree models of avian species richness, and of habitat use for 15 species across a mixed vineyard-matorral landscape in central Chile. We found a range of associations between individual species and land cover types, with the majority of species occurring most frequently in remnant habitats and ecotones rather than the interiors of large vineyard blocks. Models identified both metrics of landscape composition and patch shape as being important predictors of species occurrence, suggesting that shape metrics can complement more commonly used metrics of landscape composition. Vineyards that include corridors or islands of remnant habitat among vine blocks may increase the amount of area available to many species, although some species may still require large tracts of intact natural habitat to persist.",October 2017,biodiversity

Typical soil carbon (C) stocks used in global carbon models only account for the upper 1 meter of soil. Previously unaccounted for deep carbon pools (>1 m) were generally considered to provide a negligible input to total C contents and represent less dynamic C pools. Here we assess deep soil C pools associated with an alluvial floodplain ecosystem transitioning from agricultural production to restoration of native vegetation. We analyzed the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations of 87 surface soil samples (0–15 cm) and 23 subsurface boreholes (0–3 m). We evaluated the quantitative importance of the burial process in the sequestration of subsurface C and found our subsurface soils (0–3 m) contained considerably more C than typical C stocks of 0–1 m. This deep unaccounted soil C could have considerable implications for global C accounting. We compared differences in surface soil C related to vegetation and land use history and determined that flooding restoration could promote greater C accumulation in surface soils. We conclude deep floodplain soils may store substantial quantities of C and floodplain restoration should promote active C sequestration.",August 2017,floodplain

However, riverside levees restrict lateral connectivity of water and sediment during flood pulses, making the re-introduction of floodplain hydrogeomorphic processes through intentional levee breaching and removal an emerging floodplain restoration practice. Repeated topographic observations from levee breach sites along the lower Cosumnes River (USA) indicated that breach architecture influences floodplain and channel hydrogeomorphic processes. Where narrow breaches (<75 m) open onto graded floodplains, archetypal crevasse splays developed along a single dominant flowpath, with floodplain erosion in near-bank areas and lobate splay deposition in distal floodplain regions. Narrow breaches opening into excavated floodplain channels promoted both transverse advection and turbulent diffusion of sediment into the floodplain channel, facilitating near-bank deposition and potential breach closure. Wide breaches (>250 m) enabled multiple modes of water and sediment transport onto graded floodplains. Advective sediment transport along multiple flow paths generated overlapping crevasse splays, while turbulent diffusion promoted the formation of lateral levees through large wood and sediment accumulation in near-bank areas. Channel incision (>2 m) upstream from a wide levee breach suggests that large flow diversions through such breaches can generate water surface drawdown during flooding, resulting in localized flow acceleration and upstream channel incision. Understanding variable hydrogeomorphic responses to levee breach architecture will help restoration managers design breaches that maximize desired floodplain topographic change while also minimizing potential undesirable consequences such as levee breach closure or channel incision.",May 2017,environmental flows;floodplain;riparian

To further confound these management challenges, global climate warming and commensurate hydroclimatic alteration are likely to exacerbate scarcity of water resources and increase competition among its many consumers. Increasing water insecurity is due in part to the assumptions of stationarity in water engineering (Milly et al 2008), in part to increasing human population pressure (Vorosmarty et al 2010), and also in part to the sheer magnitude of anticipated hydrological alteration (Döll and Zhang 2010). The recent publication by Zeng et al (2017) highlights the trade-offs inherent in managing water resources for multiple demands, focusing specifically on hydropower generation versus deliveries for agricultural irrigation supply. At the global scale, the authors found that over half of all installed hydropower competes with irrigation, broadly. More specifically, the authors identified specific locations where competition for water supply between these two sectors is acute, such as in India and Central Asia, due to low streamflow availability, timing of hydropower and irrigation, and evaporative water losses from the reservoirs. Reservoir operations were more synergistic in portions of China and the United States, where demand for hydropower generation and irrigation deliveries were more synchronized seasonally. The consequences for hydroclimatic alteration, such as less snow storage, more variable river discharge, and increased reservoir loss from evaporation, further exacerbate competition for scarce water resources. The analysis by Zeng and colleagues identifies regions that would benefit from expanded trade and diversified energy-water supply portfolios as climate adaptation strategies, but leaves two areas in stark need of additional scientific research: (1) identifying effective policies for balancing trade-offs in meeting water demands under changing hydroclimatic regimes, and consequently (2) developing effective means of managing ecosystems while balancing competing demands for hydropower and irrigation. As a case in point, the most recent drought in California (see Diffenbaugh et al 2015, He et al 2017), exposed one of the world's top agricultural economies to a protracted period of water scarcity that resulted in shocks to agricultural production and labor (Howitt et al 2014), as well as reduced hydropower generation (Gleick 2015). To date, however, few studies have addressed how food–energy–water policies could be implemented to reduce such shocks and improve socioeconomic and ecosystem resilience. In addition to improved coordination among governing agencies and their information management systems (Mount et al 2016), more fundamental changes to policy and practice are needed. Changes to improve food-energy-water system resilience include economic analyses to evaluate ecosystem service versus extraction trade-offs (Grafton et al 2013, Rheinheimer et al 2013), updating water year typologies to reflect non-stationary conditions (Null and Viers 2013, Rheinheimer et al 2016), and formal climate change contingency scenarios for hydropower operations should be adopted to balance competing needs (Viers 2011). Policies are also needed for agricultural land use planning, where groundwater exploitation and degradation has resulted in unsustainable agricultural production (Famiglietti 2014, Rosenstock et al 2014). As the analysis by Zeng et al (2017) makes clear, global water security will be dependent upon several interacting forces that govern water managed for hydropower, irrigation, and ecosystems. Wada and Bierkens (2014) and others have also made it clear that the future sustainability of human water use is doubtful. Thus, the value of such water is likely to increase in the near term and likewise climate adaptation strategies are likely to modify current decision making. Choices for which lands remain in production, or which ones receive surface water irrigation supply at the expense of the environment, will be difficult. It is not a zero sum game, however. Given that hydropower dams are expected to more than double over the next 15 years globally (Zarfl et al 2014), water management strategies that balance ecosystem needs with human demands are urgently needed. A new scientific push toward getting 'more pop per drop' in environmental flow management is focusing on key functional flow components like peak magnitude flows, dry-season low flows, wet-season initiation flows, recession flows, and interannual variability to match life history strategies of focal species (Yarnell et al 2015). A future functional flow paradigm can inform reservoir operations by actively managing for ecosystem services and biodiversity while maintaining conventional operations like flood control, hydropower generation, and irrigation supply. While trade-offs are inevitable, science can help identify compatible water management actions that not only buffer against the worst effects of climate change, but meet ecosystem needs while satisfying human demands.",May 2017,management;hydropower

Assessing Ecosystem Services and Multifunctionality for Vineyard Systems. Frontiers in Environmental Science,5: 15. doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2017.00015","Vineyards shape important economic, cultural, and ecological systems in many temperate biomes. Like other agricultural systems, they can be multifunctional landscapes that not only produce grapes, but also for example serve as wildlife habitat, sequester carbon, and are places of rich traditions. However, research and management practices often focus mostly on individual, specific ecosystem services, without considering multifunctionality. Therefore, we set out to meet four research objectives: (1) evaluate how frequently the ecosystem services approach has been applied in vineyard systems; (2) identify which individual ecosystem services have been most frequently studied in vineyard systems, (3) summarize knowledge on the key ecosystem services identified in (2), and (4) illustrate approaches to multifunctionality in vineyards to inform more holistic land management. For research objective (1), we identified 45 publications that used the term “ecosystem services” in relation to vineyards, but found that only seven fully apply the ecosystem service concept to their research. For research objective (2), we operationalized the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) for 27 ecosystem services in vineyards, in order to consider provisioning, regulating, and cultural services through an analysis of more than 4,000 scientific papers that mentioned individual services. We found the six most frequently studied ecosystem services included (1) cultivated crops, (2) filtration, sequestration, storage and accumulation by the vineyards, (3) pest control and (4) disease control, (5) heritage, cultural and (6) scientific services. For research objective (3), we found that research on these six single ecosystem services is highly developed, but relationships between single ecosystem services are less studied. Therefore, we suggest that greater adoption of the ecosystem services approach could help scientists and practitioners to acknowledge the multifunctionality of the agricultural system and gain a holistic perspective that supports more sustainable land management.",April 2017,biodiversity;agriculture;management;vinecology

Flood regime typology for floodplain ecosystem management as applied to the unregulated Cosumnes River of California, United States. Ecohydrology","Floods, with their inherent spatiotemporal variability, drive floodplain physical and ecological processes. This research identifies a flood regime typology and approach for flood regime characterization, using unsupervised cluster analysis of flood events defined by ecologically meaningful metrics, including magnitude, timing, duration, and rate of change as applied to the unregulated lowland alluvial Cosumnes River of California, United States. Flood events, isolated from the 107-year daily flow record, account for approximately two-thirds of the annual flow volume. Our analysis suggests six flood types best capture the range of flood event variability. Two types are distinguished primarily by high peak flows, another by later season timing and long duration, two by small magnitudes separated by timing, and the last by later peak flow within the flood event. The flood regime was also evaluated through inter- and intra-annual frequency of the identified flood types, their relationship to water year conditions, and their long-term trends. This revealed, for example, year-to-year variability in flood types, associations between wet years and high peak magnitude types and between dry years and the low magnitude, late season flood type, and increasing and decreasing contribution to total annual flow in the highest two peak magnitude classes, respectively. This research focuses needed attention on floodplains, flood hydrology, ecological implications, and the utility of extending flow regime classification typically used for environmental flow targets. The approach is broadly applicable and extensible to other systems, where findings can be used to understand physical processes, assess change, and improve management strategies.",March 2017,

Fish invasions in California Watersheds: testing hypotheses using landscape patterns.

The inland waters of California (USA) are highly invaded, particularly by fishes, although there is wide variation in numbers of nonnative fishes across the state's watersheds. Here we examine patterns of fish invasions in California watersheds and their associations with natural environmental characteristics, native fish diversity, and various measures of human habitat disturbance. Our analysis is based on an extensive data set on the distribution of freshwater fishes across California's watersheds and on GIS land-use coverages for the entire state. We used canonical correspondence analysis to examine associations between environmental characteristics and the distributions of both native and nonnative fish species. We then employed an information-theoretic model-selection approach to rank hypothesized models derived from the fish invasion literature with regard to how well they predicted numbers of nonnative fishes in California watersheds. Our results indicate that pervasive, anthropogenic, landscape-level changes (particularly the extent of urban development, small-scale water diversions, aqueducts, and agriculture) influenced spatial patterns of invasion. In addition, we find that deliberately stocked fishes have different habitat associations, including a strong association with the presence of dams, than other introduced fishes. In our analysis, watersheds with the most native species also contain the most nonnative species. We find no evidence that existing watershed protection helps to prevent fish invasions in California, but we suggest that restoration of natural hydrologic processes may reduce invasion impacts.",October 2004,modeling;GIS;invasive-species

AGU, 83(47): B21A-0710.","Analysis of hyperspectral data is a particularly novel approach to investigation of the relation between anthropogenic and natural disturbances, geomorphic responses, and ecosystem patterns at the watershed scale. During July 2000, hyperspectral imagery was collected for the Navarro basin (820km2) using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). This NASA sensor covers the spectral wavelength range from 400nm - 2500nm, with spectral sampling of 10nm in 224 contiguous channels, and spatial resolution of 5m. These data are being analyzed for a variety of applications; however, their use for detecting patterns of disturbance within the watershed is intriguing, especially for the identification and delineation of mass wasting sites that deliver sediment to salmon bearing streams. Mass wasting sites were extracted from AVIRIS imagery using image processing techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction and Tasseled Cap transformations, image segmentation and masking. These geospatial and spectral data were analyzed for the North Fork of the Navarro River, a sub-basin where spawning habitat for threatened coho salmon is effected by accelerated sediment delivery. Additionally, fieldwork verified the spatial position and dimensions of mass-wasting sites identified from aerial photography. A subset of 1066 identified sites was used for assessing feature extraction error from the AVIRIS imagery; the remaining sites were used for model verification. Augmenting these data within GIS, a multivariate analysis incorporated: proximity to salmon bearing streams; hillslope gradient; landslide position; and timber harvesting to identify patterns of disturbance. Preliminary results indicate that AVIRIS imagery can be segmented to identify exposed soil; furthermore, these identified areas are typically lower elevation, moderately steep hillslopes in constricted river valleys and correspond with mapped delivery sites. Hyperspectral data provide a means for the detection of sediment sources over large areas; however, the geometric and atmospheric corrections required to effectively process these data can be onerous. The current work is part of an interdisciplinary study at UC Davis intended to assist land use managers in development of TMDL guidelines in coastal watersheds in northern California. Our research in the North Fork indicates that similar approaches can be used for both inventorying and monitoring of disturbance patterns at the watershed scale.",December 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;salmon

California and World Oceans, Santa Barbara, CA.","Several of northern California's coastal watersheds have been listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as requiring the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for non-point source pollution. One such case is the Navarro River watershed located in southern Mendocino County. The Navarro River was listed under the federal Clean Water Act Section 303(d) for the constituents of temperature and sediment. The Information Center for the Environment (ICE) at the University of California, Davis aided the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in the development of the TMDLs and continues to assist with ongoing work in the Navarro River watershed and other North Coast watersheds. During the summer of 2000, hyperspectral imagery was collected for the entire Navarro River watershed (∼820 km2) using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) administered by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration. This imagery covers the spectral wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm with spectral sampling of 10 nm, 224 contiguous channels, and a spatial resolution of 5 meters. Potential mass wasting sites were extracted from the AVIRIS imagery using various image processing techniques, such as the Tasseled Cap transformation, image segmentation and masking. Spectral unmixing algorithms were employed for mixed pixels (vegetation and soil) to determine the percentage of each material per pixel. Augmenting these data within a Geographic Information System (GIS), a digital elevation model was used to determine proximity to stream systems and hillslope position. This study focused on features in one sub-watershed, predominately on private timber lands: the North Fork of the Navarro River. The AVIRIS data analyzed for this area is of particular interest because it is one of the few sub-watersheds of the Navarro River complex that provides suitable spawning habitat for threatened coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Additionally, substantial fieldwork was performed in this sub-watershed to verify the spatial position and dimensions of identified mass-wasting sites. Of these approximately 1100 manually mapped and digitized mass-wasting sites, one-half were used for assessing commission and omission errors of features extracted from the AVIRIS imagery. The other sites were used to assess the accuracy of the terrain-based model SHALSTAB, which predicts landslide potential. Hyperspectral data do provide a means for the inventorying and monitoring of sediment delivery sites over large areas; however, the geometric and atmospheric corrections required to effectively process these data can be onerous. The utilization of hyperspectral imagery for watershed analysis is novel and holds great promise for future TMDL assessments, but it is not without limitations. The sheer volume of data, over 300 Gigabytes for the Navarro River watershed alone, can be overwhelming to an ill-equipped processing laboratory. Furthermore, comprehensive fieldwork is necessary for more advanced applications of spectral separability and identification. As hyperspectral data are incorporated into future watershed research programs, many of these benefits and limitations will be addressed. Although the identification of mass-wasting features was performed post-hoc for the Navarro River watershed, our research indicates that similar approaches can be used for other watersheds for a variety of purposes with success.",October 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;pollution;salmon

As required by this section and subsequent litigation, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (NCRWQCB) is under consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these constituents. Sediment and temperature are non-point source pollutants that impair the listed beneficial uses for the river, particularly cold water fisheries for endangered salmonid populations.

To address the sediment TMDL, roads and mass-wasting features were inventoried. The mass-wasting inventory identified all discreet and chronic sediment sources through the use of five sets of stereoscopic aerial photographs spanning five decades. The road inventory focused on contemporary features and was implemented in a similar manner. Current 1:24,000-scale GIS data served as the base for aerial photobased augmentation. To support the temperature TMDL, ICE developed GIS-based inputs for the Stream Segment Temperature Model (SSTEMP), such as location, distance upstream from the mouth, elevation, and average shade for each reach in the stream network.

However, the numbers of juvenile steelhead and spawning adults have declined greatly over the past 100 years, while coho salmon rearing and spawning is now limited to only one sub-drainage. Steelhead and coho population data taken by the DFG along with GIS images of recent land-use change are being used in conjunction with sediment core data to determine specific land-use effects on watershed geomorphology and in-stream habitat quality. The study uses historical information on land use, fish populations, and river flow along with a multi-proxy analysis of cores taken from the Navarro floodplain to reconstruct geomorphic effects of land-use change and includes geochemical, palynological, grain size, LOI, and radiocarbon analyses. An historical analysis of logging operations within the watershed indicates three periods of increased mill operations peaking in 1952 with 32 mills. Digitized aerials from 1936 show the distribution of land-uses, including large swaths of clear-cut land. When these data are combined with a 100-yr record of fish distribution and a 50 yr record of discharge, a timeline of cumulative impacts is available for comparing against the multi-proxy record. For example, results from geochemical analyses may indicate anthropogenic effects on watershed sediment transport. A spike in Hg concentration at a depth of ~5 m occurs in all cores and an increase in concentrations of Hg, Cu, Co, Ba, Cr, and Ni begins at 3 m in most. Geochemical ternary diagrams of different core locations and depths show that sediment depositing in the floodplain of sub-drainages differ from main stem sediment, indicating spatio-temporal changes in sediment source areas. A palynological investigation is being conducted which will provide data of changes in ecosystem structure through time and will aid estimates of recent sedimentation rates.",May 2001,pollution;floodplain;salmon

Pgs 269-288","The decline of native fish populations and the invasion of non-native fishes are the most noticeable trends in California's freshwater fish assemblages over the last century (Moyle and Williams 1990, Moyle 2000). Moyle (2000) and Dill and Cordone (1997) date the first introduction of non-native fish into California back to the latter half of the 19th Century. Yoshiyama et al. (1998) place the beginning of the decline of the state's chinook salmon populations also near the turn of the century. The mid-1800's also marks the beginning of a population explosion in California, driven by the discovery of gold in the Sierra Nevada in 1848.",January 2001,invasive-species;salmon

Climatic and spatial patterns of diversity in the serpentine plants of California. Diversity & Distributions 6(3), 153-162","The insular distribution of distinctive substrates, such as outcrops of serpentine rock, may either promote plant diversity by enhancing opportunities for speciation or reduce diversity by increasing rates of extinction. To examine the relationship between diversity and the spatial structure of habitats, we studied large-scale patterns of diversity in the flora of serpentine in California. We used multiple linear regressions on geographical information system (GIS)-derived data for 85 subregions of the state to analyse the climatic and spatial correlates of plant species richness. The diversity of plants endemic to serpentine declined from north to south and from the coast inland, in association with decreasing rainfall; the same trends were seen in the total flora, but the trends were stronger in serpentine endemics. Diversity of serpentine endemics increased with the area of serpentine and decreased with the mean isolation of serpentine patches in a subregion. The diversity of endemics was not correlated with the number of serpentine patches or their mean perimeter-to-area ratio. We conclude that patchiness in this terrestrial habitat does not appear to promote diversity, even at the large spatial scale associated with speciation and endemism.",May 2000,GIS;biodiversity;serpentine

San Diego, CA.","The Navarro River watershed hosts one of the last extant populations of coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in the Central California Evolutionarily Significant Unit. As such, the identification and restoration of riparian habitats in the Navarro River watershed is paramount to the continued survival of this coho salmon population. This study utilizes a modeling procedure to identify priority locations in the Navarro River watershed using a geographic information system (GIS). This riparian habitat modeling method was used to identify priority restoration sites in the Navarro River watershed. The modeling structure emphasizes a hydrological metric, wetness index, and several landuse – land cover parameters. This GIS based model of the Navarro River was used for selecting potential riparian restoration sites, and used to demonstrate the utility of the model for selection of potential salmonid habitat. The results of analyzing the similarity between two model runs, one emphasizing habitat potential and the other anthropogenic degradation, indicate that riverine–riparian habitats have been disproportionately affected. This effort is offered as a potential tool to aid resource managers and local stakeholders with a method in which to initiate protection of aquatic ecological systems and coho salmon habitat in particular.",February 1999,modeling;GIS;riparian;salmon

Improving Water Quality Reporting in California with the GeoWaterbody System. 1998 ESRI International User Conference Proceedings. San Diego, CA.","In California, water quality assessment information is currently reported via a FoxPro (DOS) system known as the WaterBody System (WBS). WBS does not have a spatial component, and therefore users typically enter information for large named water courses. Several states, including California, have developed links from WBS waterbodies to EPA River Reach File (RF3-alpha) features, spatially referencing WBS to an existing nationwide hydrography layer. This spatial referencing step, however, has typically occurred after local scientists and resource managers entered assessment information into the WBS. In order to improve water quality reporting, the University of California, Davis (UCD) Information Center for the Environment (ICE) has developed GeoWBS, a customized graphical user interface using ArcView and the Dialog Designer Extension that allows users entering water quality assessment information to better spatially define waterbodies. This system links the assessment information to RF3-alpha, permits direct SQL connectivity to the underlying WBS architecture, and helps standardize user input. Starting in 1998, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) scientists will be trained to use the system and will report their assessments on more spatially refined waterbodies. Consequently, the water quality assessment information reported to EPA will be more spatially precise, queriable through a graphical interface, and will likely result in improved water quality monitoring, reporting, and policy-setting.",February 1998,GIS;hydrology

California's Experience with the River Reach File. 1997 ESRI International User Conference Proceedings. San Diego, CA.","Organized hydrographic information is vital to the success of environmental planning and management. Joint efforts from the USGS and U.S. EPA to produce a spatial base and attribute model, respectively, have resulted in an alpha release of the River Reach File, a national hydrographic standard (RF3-alpha). In California, this represents over 200,000 records of hydrographic features maintained and distributed by the state's Teale GIS Technology Center in ARC/INFO format for use by public agencies and the private sector. This paper summarizes the key events, beginning in 1992, with the California Department of Fish and Game's GIS program, which have led to the revision and correction of over 60,000 RF3 records in cooperation with federal, state, University of California at Davis (UCD), and private entities. The detail in the revisions ranges from complete hydrograhic address enumeration in portions of the Eel River basin, to statewide reconciliation of USGS hydrographic names with the RF1 and RF2 names. Benefits in addition to the strong cooperative relationships identified include the enabling of Internet-based search and query capabilities by state-level programs such as the California Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES) and the California Rivers Assessment (CARA). Future development of RF3 will focus on empowering individuals and watershed interest groups with a robust spatial and attribute standard for hydrographic information of all types, extents, and applications.",February 1997,GIS;hydrology
