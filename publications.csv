In this study, we assess the public and private costs and benefits of distributed desalination in the Central Valley (CV) of California. We employ environmental and economic modeling to estimate the value of reducing the salinity of irrigation water; the value of augmenting water supply under present and future climate scenarios; and the human health, environmental, and climate change damages associated with generating power to desalinate water. We find that water desalination is only likely to be profitable in 4% of the CV during periods of severe drought, and that current costs would need to decrease by 70–90% for adoption to occur on the median acre. Fossil-fuel powered desalination technologies also generate air emissions that impose significant public costs in the form of human health and climate change damages, although these damages vary greatly depending on technology. The ecosystem service benefits of reduced agricultural drainage would need to be valued between $800 and $1200 per acre-foot, or nearly the full capital and operational costs of water desalination, for the net benefits of water desalination to be positive from a societal perspective.",December 2017,modeling;agriculture;management

Ecological data and studies for the region are also limited, making informed conservation in agricultural landscapes difficult. The increasing availability of remotely sensed data provide opportunities to relate species occurrences to measures of landscape heterogeneity even when field measures of habitat structure are lacking. When working with such remotely sensed data, it’s important to select appropriate measures of heterogeneity, including common metrics of landscape composition as well as frequently overlooked shape metrics. In this contribution we combine bird surveys with multispectral satellite imagery to develop boosted regression tree models of avian species richness, and of habitat use for 15 species across a mixed vineyard-matorral landscape in central Chile. We found a range of associations between individual species and land cover types, with the majority of species occurring most frequently in remnant habitats and ecotones rather than the interiors of large vineyard blocks. Models identified both metrics of landscape composition and patch shape as being important predictors of species occurrence, suggesting that shape metrics can complement more commonly used metrics of landscape composition. Vineyards that include corridors or islands of remnant habitat among vine blocks may increase the amount of area available to many species, although some species may still require large tracts of intact natural habitat to persist.",October 2017,biodiversity

Typical soil carbon (C) stocks used in global carbon models only account for the upper 1 meter of soil. Previously unaccounted for deep carbon pools (>1 m) were generally considered to provide a negligible input to total C contents and represent less dynamic C pools. Here we assess deep soil C pools associated with an alluvial floodplain ecosystem transitioning from agricultural production to restoration of native vegetation. We analyzed the soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations of 87 surface soil samples (0–15 cm) and 23 subsurface boreholes (0–3 m). We evaluated the quantitative importance of the burial process in the sequestration of subsurface C and found our subsurface soils (0–3 m) contained considerably more C than typical C stocks of 0–1 m. This deep unaccounted soil C could have considerable implications for global C accounting. We compared differences in surface soil C related to vegetation and land use history and determined that flooding restoration could promote greater C accumulation in surface soils. We conclude deep floodplain soils may store substantial quantities of C and floodplain restoration should promote active C sequestration.",August 2017,floodplain

However, riverside levees restrict lateral connectivity of water and sediment during flood pulses, making the re-introduction of floodplain hydrogeomorphic processes through intentional levee breaching and removal an emerging floodplain restoration practice. Repeated topographic observations from levee breach sites along the lower Cosumnes River (USA) indicated that breach architecture influences floodplain and channel hydrogeomorphic processes. Where narrow breaches (<75 m) open onto graded floodplains, archetypal crevasse splays developed along a single dominant flowpath, with floodplain erosion in near-bank areas and lobate splay deposition in distal floodplain regions. Narrow breaches opening into excavated floodplain channels promoted both transverse advection and turbulent diffusion of sediment into the floodplain channel, facilitating near-bank deposition and potential breach closure. Wide breaches (>250 m) enabled multiple modes of water and sediment transport onto graded floodplains. Advective sediment transport along multiple flow paths generated overlapping crevasse splays, while turbulent diffusion promoted the formation of lateral levees through large wood and sediment accumulation in near-bank areas. Channel incision (>2 m) upstream from a wide levee breach suggests that large flow diversions through such breaches can generate water surface drawdown during flooding, resulting in localized flow acceleration and upstream channel incision. Understanding variable hydrogeomorphic responses to levee breach architecture will help restoration managers design breaches that maximize desired floodplain topographic change while also minimizing potential undesirable consequences such as levee breach closure or channel incision.",May 2017,environmental flows;floodplain;riparian

To further confound these management challenges, global climate warming and commensurate hydroclimatic alteration are likely to exacerbate scarcity of water resources and increase competition among its many consumers. Increasing water insecurity is due in part to the assumptions of stationarity in water engineering (Milly et al 2008), in part to increasing human population pressure (Vorosmarty et al 2010), and also in part to the sheer magnitude of anticipated hydrological alteration (Döll and Zhang 2010). The recent publication by Zeng et al (2017) highlights the trade-offs inherent in managing water resources for multiple demands, focusing specifically on hydropower generation versus deliveries for agricultural irrigation supply. At the global scale, the authors found that over half of all installed hydropower competes with irrigation, broadly. More specifically, the authors identified specific locations where competition for water supply between these two sectors is acute, such as in India and Central Asia, due to low streamflow availability, timing of hydropower and irrigation, and evaporative water losses from the reservoirs. Reservoir operations were more synergistic in portions of China and the United States, where demand for hydropower generation and irrigation deliveries were more synchronized seasonally. The consequences for hydroclimatic alteration, such as less snow storage, more variable river discharge, and increased reservoir loss from evaporation, further exacerbate competition for scarce water resources. The analysis by Zeng and colleagues identifies regions that would benefit from expanded trade and diversified energy-water supply portfolios as climate adaptation strategies, but leaves two areas in stark need of additional scientific research: (1) identifying effective policies for balancing trade-offs in meeting water demands under changing hydroclimatic regimes, and consequently (2) developing effective means of managing ecosystems while balancing competing demands for hydropower and irrigation. As a case in point, the most recent drought in California (see Diffenbaugh et al 2015, He et al 2017), exposed one of the world's top agricultural economies to a protracted period of water scarcity that resulted in shocks to agricultural production and labor (Howitt et al 2014), as well as reduced hydropower generation (Gleick 2015). To date, however, few studies have addressed how food–energy–water policies could be implemented to reduce such shocks and improve socioeconomic and ecosystem resilience. In addition to improved coordination among governing agencies and their information management systems (Mount et al 2016), more fundamental changes to policy and practice are needed. Changes to improve food-energy-water system resilience include economic analyses to evaluate ecosystem service versus extraction trade-offs (Grafton et al 2013, Rheinheimer et al 2013), updating water year typologies to reflect non-stationary conditions (Null and Viers 2013, Rheinheimer et al 2016), and formal climate change contingency scenarios for hydropower operations should be adopted to balance competing needs (Viers 2011). Policies are also needed for agricultural land use planning, where groundwater exploitation and degradation has resulted in unsustainable agricultural production (Famiglietti 2014, Rosenstock et al 2014). As the analysis by Zeng et al (2017) makes clear, global water security will be dependent upon several interacting forces that govern water managed for hydropower, irrigation, and ecosystems. Wada and Bierkens (2014) and others have also made it clear that the future sustainability of human water use is doubtful. Thus, the value of such water is likely to increase in the near term and likewise climate adaptation strategies are likely to modify current decision making. Choices for which lands remain in production, or which ones receive surface water irrigation supply at the expense of the environment, will be difficult. It is not a zero sum game, however. Given that hydropower dams are expected to more than double over the next 15 years globally (Zarfl et al 2014), water management strategies that balance ecosystem needs with human demands are urgently needed. A new scientific push toward getting 'more pop per drop' in environmental flow management is focusing on key functional flow components like peak magnitude flows, dry-season low flows, wet-season initiation flows, recession flows, and interannual variability to match life history strategies of focal species (Yarnell et al 2015). A future functional flow paradigm can inform reservoir operations by actively managing for ecosystem services and biodiversity while maintaining conventional operations like flood control, hydropower generation, and irrigation supply. While trade-offs are inevitable, science can help identify compatible water management actions that not only buffer against the worst effects of climate change, but meet ecosystem needs while satisfying human demands.",May 2017,management;hydropower

Assessing Ecosystem Services and Multifunctionality for Vineyard Systems. Frontiers in Environmental Science,5: 15. doi: 10.3389/fenvs.2017.00015","Vineyards shape important economic, cultural, and ecological systems in many temperate biomes. Like other agricultural systems, they can be multifunctional landscapes that not only produce grapes, but also for example serve as wildlife habitat, sequester carbon, and are places of rich traditions. However, research and management practices often focus mostly on individual, specific ecosystem services, without considering multifunctionality. Therefore, we set out to meet four research objectives: (1) evaluate how frequently the ecosystem services approach has been applied in vineyard systems; (2) identify which individual ecosystem services have been most frequently studied in vineyard systems, (3) summarize knowledge on the key ecosystem services identified in (2), and (4) illustrate approaches to multifunctionality in vineyards to inform more holistic land management. For research objective (1), we identified 45 publications that used the term “ecosystem services” in relation to vineyards, but found that only seven fully apply the ecosystem service concept to their research. For research objective (2), we operationalized the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) for 27 ecosystem services in vineyards, in order to consider provisioning, regulating, and cultural services through an analysis of more than 4,000 scientific papers that mentioned individual services. We found the six most frequently studied ecosystem services included (1) cultivated crops, (2) filtration, sequestration, storage and accumulation by the vineyards, (3) pest control and (4) disease control, (5) heritage, cultural and (6) scientific services. For research objective (3), we found that research on these six single ecosystem services is highly developed, but relationships between single ecosystem services are less studied. Therefore, we suggest that greater adoption of the ecosystem services approach could help scientists and practitioners to acknowledge the multifunctionality of the agricultural system and gain a holistic perspective that supports more sustainable land management.",April 2017,biodiversity;agriculture;management;vinecology

Flood regime typology for floodplain ecosystem management as applied to the unregulated Cosumnes River of California, United States. Ecohydrology","Floods, with their inherent spatiotemporal variability, drive floodplain physical and ecological processes. This research identifies a flood regime typology and approach for flood regime characterization, using unsupervised cluster analysis of flood events defined by ecologically meaningful metrics, including magnitude, timing, duration, and rate of change as applied to the unregulated lowland alluvial Cosumnes River of California, United States. Flood events, isolated from the 107-year daily flow record, account for approximately two-thirds of the annual flow volume. Our analysis suggests six flood types best capture the range of flood event variability. Two types are distinguished primarily by high peak flows, another by later season timing and long duration, two by small magnitudes separated by timing, and the last by later peak flow within the flood event. The flood regime was also evaluated through inter- and intra-annual frequency of the identified flood types, their relationship to water year conditions, and their long-term trends. This revealed, for example, year-to-year variability in flood types, associations between wet years and high peak magnitude types and between dry years and the low magnitude, late season flood type, and increasing and decreasing contribution to total annual flow in the highest two peak magnitude classes, respectively. This research focuses needed attention on floodplains, flood hydrology, ecological implications, and the utility of extending flow regime classification typically used for environmental flow targets. The approach is broadly applicable and extensible to other systems, where findings can be used to understand physical processes, assess change, and improve management strategies.",March 2017,
