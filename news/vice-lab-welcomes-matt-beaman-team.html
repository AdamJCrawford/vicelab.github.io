                    Matt joined VICE lab as a junior specialist in the fall of 2016. He graduated from California State University, Stanislaus
                    in May 2016 with a B.S. in geology. His prior research experience includes collection of geophysical
                    data in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and conducting GIS analyses to assist paleontological
                    research in California’s Central Valley. He currently supports the study of Northeast Delta restoration
                    benefits through the development of novel high resolution water quality and bathymetric mapping methods
                    and assisting in field data collection. Matt’s research interests are in understanding surficial processes
                    through geospatial technologies and how this information may be used to benefit water management and
                    conservation in a changing climate.
