                    VICE Lab's Lorenzo Booth was recently highlighted for his research supported by UC Water, where he picked up the
                    <a href="http://www.ucmerced.edu/news/2016/grad-student%E2%80%99s-water-mapping-work-leads-national-recognition">2016 AWRA GIS Speciality Conference</a> student poster award (and a fat check!). UC Merced graduate student
                    Lorenzo Booth’s research into more efficient use of water for agriculture has earned him accolades from
                    the American Water Resources Association for not only producing information, but presenting solutions.
                    <br/>
                    “If we can make the process of growing food more efficient and sustainable,” that’s a good thing,” Booth
                    said. At UC Merced, Booth discovered he’s a pretty good programmer, and used his skills to build a computer
                    program that compares water usage for different crops in different locations. He demonstrated his work
                    at a recent conference with a poster titled “Improved Agricultural Water Use Accounting Through Water
                    Footprinting.” The association named him the best student poster presenter.
