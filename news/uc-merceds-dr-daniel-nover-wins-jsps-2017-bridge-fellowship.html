                    The Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) recently awarded the 2017 BRIDGE Fellowship to Dr. Daniel Nover
                    from UC Mercedâ€™s School of Engineering. The BRIDGE Fellowship is designed to build collaborations between
                    American scientists and engineers who have been funded by JSPS in the past with Japanese researchers
                    at qualifying universities. Dr. Nover will spend October as a visiting fellow in the Yamashiki Lab at
                    Kyoto University where he will work to build research partnerships in water resources and disaster risk
                    management. Additionally, he will work to build international exchanges between UC Merced and Kyoto University.
