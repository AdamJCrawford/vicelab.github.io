                    Johnathan Deas is the electric vehicle intern for CITRIS at the University of California, Merced. His duties include developing
                    a dynamic stator control system for use in what could become a potentially more efficient electric motor.
                    The intention is to allow more constant usage of current in order to extend the life of current battery
                    technologies. While this project is currently in its early stages, much of the groundwork has been made
                    in creating a state-space model. The intended goal of this project is to create a detailed mathematical
                    model of this motor and control system.

                    <br/>VICE Lab is assisting with UAV deployment and multisensor data gathering. Vineyards are ideal testbeds
                    for robotic solutions to complex navigation and task assignments. These breakthroughs in agricultural
                    technology are the focus of UC Merced's emerging focus on San Joaquin Valley problems at the coupled
                    human-environment interface.
