anna-rallings,Anna Rallings,Lab Manger,arallings@ucmerced.edu,https://twitter.com/anna_rallings,"Anna Rallings has been with the VICElab since October 2017, serving as both a staff researcher and the lab's manager. She has a MS in Integrated Land & Food Systems from the University of British Columbia, Canada for her work on integration of natural vegetation into multifunctional farmlands for habitat and carbon storage enhancements. Previously she worked at Kwantlen Polytechnic University in Canada in sustainable agriculture and food systems analysis. Anna specializes in environmental sciences, landscape ecology, and GIS. <br> Anna is currently involved in research focusing on floodplain restoration in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as well as environmental flows related to hydropower operations. Her primary interest is in the integration of multi-objective ecological restoration into managed landscapes, such as California's Central Valley. On any given day, you can find her on a boat in the Delta or running geospatial models in ArcGIS. "

RESEARCHERS,,,,,
alan-cai,Alan Cai,Graduate Student,acai4@ucmerced.edu,,"Alan is a Master's student in the Environmental Systems Graduate Group and VICE Lab at UC Merced, having joined in July 2017. He is interested in using the tools of science and policy to better manage ecosystems, particularly rivers, for a variety of objectives. Alan majored in environmental and atmospheric science at UC Berkeley, graduating in 2014. He then did internships in applied ecosystem science and land use policy in the San Francisco Bay Area and Washington state. <br>  Alan's research project currently involves a survey of Western United States hydropower facility operators.  He is interested in gaining a baseline understanding of the priorities, attitudes, and decision-making processes of this group, with a focus on environmental flows.  Given how important their actions are to the water resources, energy and riverine ecosystem arenas, Alan hopes to obtain insights that can inform models of optimized hydropower operations under conditions of climate change and multi-objective decision-making."
vicky-espinoza,Vicky Espinoza,Graduate Student,vespinoza2@ucmerced.edu,,"Vicky joined the VICElab as a PhD student in fall of 2017. She graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2017 with a Master of Science degree in Environmental Engineering. She obtained her Bachelor of Science degree in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago. Prior applied research experiences at Argonne National Laboratory, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pomona College Geology Department, and University of Alaska Fairbanks include research in various fields like atmospheric and ocean chemistry, energy-water systems, and climate change impacts on atmospheric river trends. She has also been actively involved in making science and mathematics accessible to underrepresented, Spanish-speaking communities through outreach and tutoring throughout her educational career. <br> Vicky's research addresses sustainable water management for global food, energy, and water security. She is analyzing how California's Sustainable Groundwater Management Act will impact the retirement of more than 10% of San Joaquin Valley's irrigated lands, and how those land use change will affect already socioeconomically vulnerable communities within the region. Overall, her research will offer a vision for strategizing how and where to retire large blocks of land and suggest alternative land uses that will maximize the benefit to the economy, environment, farmers, and underrepresented communities. She hopes that her research will translate into broad insights that can inform water management and policy, while resulting in more equitable solutions for disadvantaged communities in California and beyond."
lorenzo-booth,Lorenzo Booth,Graduate Student,lbooth@ucmerced.edu,,"A California native, Lorenzo obtained a B.S. in Environmental Engineering and M.S. in environmental systems from University of California, Merced. He is interested in the sustainable development of water resources and applications of remote sensing and robotics methods in environmental and agricultural science. He is also a strong supporter of Free/Libre and Open-Source software and hardware. <br> He is currently working with Dr. Stefano Carpin and Dr. Joshua Viers to develop methods of surveying environmental and agricultural systems with coupled robotic platforms and aerial sensors."
andy-anderson,Andreas Anderson,UAV Specialist,aanderson29@ucmerced.edu,,"Andreas joined VICE Lab in September of 2016, after graduating from UC Merced with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. During his studies at UC Merced he was a member of MESA Lab, where he applied his experience as an RC airplane hobbyist and became one of the lab's flight instructors. His projects at MESA also included building a prop test bench, converting RC aircraft into autonomous UAS, and acting as a drone pilot for scientific data collection focused on water stress in almond orchards. <br> Working for VICE Lab, Andreas has used drones to create high-resolution elevation maps for hydrology modeling in the Avocet Pond region of the Merced Vernal Pools & Grassland Reserve. He was also engaged in monitoring flooding and habitat restoration in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, using multispectral cameras and LiDAR. Currently Andreas is working on applying the METRIC evaprotranspiration model to UAV footage of a vineyard."
daniel-gomez,Daniel Gomez,Junior Specialist,dgomez50@ucmerced.edu,,"Daniel joined the VICE Lab as a Junior Specialist in October 2017. He graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2013 with a B.A. in Earth Science with a concentration in Geology. Since graduating, Daniel has worked in various projects throughout California and the Pacific Northwest, working with shorebirds, songbirds, seabirds, salmonids and water quality research. His research has taken him to the coast, forests, deserts, and mountains. <br> Daniel is an experienced boater and before joining the VICE Lab was working with the National Park Service providing technical support to the long term water monitoring program at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park and Curecanti National Recreation Area collecting field data on core parameters, such as flow, water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and specific conductance, as well laboratory analyses, including fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli), major ions, trace elements, and nutrients. In the future, Daniel wants to pursue a higher degree in Hydrology and is interested in surface water and groundwater interactions, remote sensing for water quality, and isotope hydrology. <br>  He currently supports the study of water quality and isotope hydrology at the William McCormick Track in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River North East Delta, which has been highlighted in multiple management plans for both flood protection, ecosystem benefits, and restoration efforts.

mike-kalua,Mike Kalua,Junior Specialist,mkalua@ucmerced.edu,,"Mike joined VICELab as a Student Assistant while he was an undergraduate at University of California, Merced studying Environmental Engineering. As a Student Assistant Mike used GIS to create hydrological maps of various study sites around the globe. During his undergraduate studies, Mike also spent a summer as a Mountain Hydrology Field Work Assistant with the Sierra Nevada Research Institute. There he helped to fabricate and install wireless sensor networks for snow monitoring and develop stream rating curves near the Emigrant Wilderness. He graduated and received his B.S. in the Spring of 2018.
