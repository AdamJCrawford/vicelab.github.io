        The Center for Spatial Technologies and Remote Sensing (CSTARS), directed by Susan L. Ustin at UC Davis has been known for
        leadership in environmental applications of remote sensing and geospatial data for three decades. The Centerâ€™s research
        focus is on characterizing ecosystem processes and structure, especially aspects that address impacts of climate
        and land use changes, environmental sustainability and ecosystem services.
