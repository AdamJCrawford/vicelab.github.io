discussing-water-management-and-food-security-with-californias-legistators,Discussing Water Management and Food Security with California's Legistators,vicky-espinoza,March 2019,"Two UC Merced Ph.D. students, including Vicky Espinoza from our research lab, took to the State Capitol yesterday with representatives from the other UC campuses to advocate for the importance of the research being done across California. Accompanied by Vice Provost and Graduate Dean Marjorie Zatz, they met with state leaders during the UC’s 10th annual Graduate Research Advocacy Day. Vicky's research 'offers insight into how to sustain California’s food, energy and water systems, at a broader scale, not just California but global food and water security'. <a href=https://news.ucmerced.edu/news/2019/graduate-students-make-case-research-capitol>Read the full article here!</a>"

Vineyards are ideal testbeds for robotic solutions to complex navigation and task assignments. These breakthroughs in agricultural technology are the focus of UC Merced's emerging focus on San Joaquin Valley problems at the coupled human-environment interface. Carpin told IEEE that he expects to be done with a prototype of his robot next year, when his team will also be installing adjustable emitters to the irrigation pipes. He expects to start testing the system on an actual farm by the summer of 2020."

UC Merced graduate student Lorenzo Booth’s research into more efficient use of water for agriculture has earned him accolades from the American Water Resources Association for not only producing information, but presenting solutions. 'If we can make the process of growing food more efficient and sustainable, that’s a good thing,' Booth said. He scripted a program that compares water usage for different crops in different locations, and demonstrated his work at a recent conference with a poster titled Improved Agricultural Water Use Accounting Through Water Footprinting. The association named him the best student poster presenter. <a href=http://www.ucmerced.edu/news/2016/grad-student%E2%80%99s-water-mapping-work-leads-national-recognition>See the full article here!</a>"

He graduated from California State University, Stanislaus in May 2016 with a B.S. in geology. His prior research experience includes collection of geophysical data in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and conducting GIS analyses to assist paleontological research in California’s Central Valley. He currently supports the study of Northeast Delta restoration benefits through the development of novel high resolution water quality and bathymetric mapping methods and assisting in field data collection. Matt’s research interests are in understanding surficial processes through geospatial technologies and how this information may be used to benefit water management and conservation in a changing climate."

In March 2016 that experience paid off. Whipple was awarded a prestigious Delta Science Fellowship to continue her research on achieving more functional landscapes through land-water interactions. Advised by Prof. Joshua Viers, Whipple's focus on spatio-temporal variation of floodplain habitat for restoration management will serve planning for California's water resources and beyond.   A press release by Caitlin Coomber describes the grant. This article was orginally published March 22, 2016 on the Sea Grant California website.  California Sea Grant is pleased to announce the selection of 12 outstanding doctoral graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as recipients of the 2016 Delta Science Fellowship. Awarded periodically by the Delta Stewardship Council’s Delta Science Program and administered by California Sea Grant, the fellowship partners junior scientists with academic and community mentors to work on collaborative data analysis and research projects applicable to the California Bay-Delta system. 'Getting early-career support can be pivotal for the success of a young scientist,' said Cliff Dahm, Lead Scientist of the Delta Science Program. 'The Delta Science Fellowship Program allows us to invest in the next generation of researchers studying water issues in the California Delta, while advancing our overall understanding of the complex Bay-Delta ecosystem. This scientific research aids the goals of the Delta Stewardship Council and informs policy-makers and managers concerned with the long-term health and vitality of the Delta.' Drawn from five colleges and universities in California and Washington state, the 2016 Delta Science Fellows represent a diverse variety of research interests.  California Sea Grant administers the fellowship program on behalf of the Delta Science Program. With additional financial commitment from funding partners, NOAA Fisheries Southwest Fisheries Science Center and State and Federal Contractors Water Agency (SFCWA), 12 candidates were selected, making up the largest class of Delta Science Fellows ever awarded."
cdfw-brown-bag-brown-rivers-black-swans,CDFW Brown Bag on Brown Rivers & Black Swans,josh-viers,May 2015,"Black Swans, Brown River: How a Levee Failure Transformed Floodplain Restoration and Management in California's Central Valley – May 21, 2015. Presented by Dr. Joshua Viers: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Lectures/Archive#swan. Transformative events shaping human histories, perceptions, and modalities can be considered to be of the Black Swan variety. Black Swans, in this context, are unanticipated events with significant impact, yet in hindsight appear perfectly predictable. Flood events and ensuing social-ecological transformations are an archetype Black Swan. In this paper, we illustrate how a Black Swan event transformed not only a riverine floodplain, but also initiated a paradigm shift in thinking and approach to riverine floodplain restoration. In 1986, a relatively routine levee failure along the banks of the Cosumnes River led to the establishment of an “accidental” forest. The forest was not the surprise, rather it was the shift in thinking. In retrospect, of course, it was perfectly predictable that following the levee failure, floodplain restoration approaches would focus on initiating hydroecological processes, rather than on mimicking biological composition and pattern. Subsequently, the transformation in thinking has led to a scientific focus on ecological effects of hydrological process, including intentional levee breaching and promotion of flooded floodplains. We explore the role of Black Swans at the interface of ecosystem disturbance and human reaction within this emergent paradigm with a new focus on the use of setback levees and levee breaching to promote process-based restoration of Central Valley floodplains for multiple social-ecological benefits."

The paper sited in the piece outlines the need to more fully understand water usages across the state. Such a system, Grantham and Viers suggest, would not require major changes in the laws governing water use, but could encourage over-users to conserve. These sorts of forward-thinking measures could free up more water for cities, fish, and wildlife. <a href=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/opinion/measure-californias-water.html>Read the full article here!</a>"
