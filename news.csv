usda-project-engadget,USDA project featured in Engadget,stefano-carpin,June 2018,"The precision irrigation project led by UC Merced Professor Stefano Carpin was featured in Engadget! VICE Lab is assisting with UAV deployment and multisensor data gathering. Vineyards are ideal testbeds for robotic solutions to complex navigation and task assignments. These breakthroughs in agricultural technology are the focus of UC Merced's emerging focus on San Joaquin Valley problems at the coupled human-environment interface."
motorboat-operator-training-course,Motorboat Operator Training Course,selina-davila-olivera,November 2017,"Three VICE Lab researchers got the opportunity to work with James Fitzgerald from the UC Davis Bodega Bay Marine Lab, taking his Motorboat Operator Training Course.  James Fitzgerald is the standing UC Davis Boat Safety Officer, and was instrumental in teaching our VICE Lab researchers the basics of boat mechanics, nagivation, knot tying, and general water safety. James parters with local UC Davis students and staff as well as UC Davis Bodega Bay firefighters to run this program, offering unique learning opportunities including how to run rescue drills, form huddles in water (see image below), and how to perform evasive maneuvers."

The BRIDGE Fellowship is designed to build collaborations between American scientists and engineers who have been funded by JSPS in the past with Japanese researchers at qualifying universities. Dr. Nover will spend October as a visiting fellow in the Yamashiki Lab at Kyoto University where he will work to build research partnerships in water resources and disaster risk management. Additionally, he will work to build international exchanges between UC Merced and Kyoto University."
