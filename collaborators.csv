Mauter's WE3 lab at the Carnegie Mellon University Environmental Engineering, Sustainability and Science Research Group works to promote resource efficiency in water and energy systems by addressing technical and policy barriers their implementation. The interdisciplinary nature of this work requires leveraging skills in both Chemical Engineering and Engineering & Public Policy, deploying expertise in nanoscience, physicochemical processes, polymers and soft materials, optimization modeling, spatial statistics, regression analysis, and life cycle assessment."
nicholas-lab,Nicholas Lab,kim-nicholas,http://www.kimnicholas.com/,"Kim Nicholas is an Associate Professor of Sustainability Science at the Lund University Centre for Sustainability Studies (LUCSUS) in Lund, Sweden. Her research motivation is to understand what human changes to the Earth’s climate and land surface will mean for the future of the ecosystems on which we depend, and how we can better balance human needs with sustaining the planet’s life support systems. Her interest in sustainable food is rooted in five generations of farming history in her hometown of Sonoma, California."
