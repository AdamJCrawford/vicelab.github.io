San Diego, CA.","Researchers at the Information Center for the Environment (ICE) are using ArcGIS to inventory and monitor environmental risks to California’s north, coastal watersheds. In collaboration with state agencies, ICE has created a comprehensive GIS for selected watersheds in which water quality improvement and endangered species recovery is paramount. ICE has leveraged hyperspectral imagery, extensive field data, and framework datasets to provide resources managers with single source content to make decisions concerning the environmental risk of landslide potential; alterations in aquatic habitat; and land use change, among many. Our results indicate that a geospatial framework for information brokerage is critical for assessing land use decisions at a watershed scale.",July 2003,GIS;management

AGU, 83(47): B21A-0710.","Analysis of hyperspectral data is a particularly novel approach to investigation of the relation between anthropogenic and natural disturbances, geomorphic responses, and ecosystem patterns at the watershed scale. During July 2000, hyperspectral imagery was collected for the Navarro basin (820km2) using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). This NASA sensor covers the spectral wavelength range from 400nm - 2500nm, with spectral sampling of 10nm in 224 contiguous channels, and spatial resolution of 5m. These data are being analyzed for a variety of applications; however, their use for detecting patterns of disturbance within the watershed is intriguing, especially for the identification and delineation of mass wasting sites that deliver sediment to salmon bearing streams. Mass wasting sites were extracted from AVIRIS imagery using image processing techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction and Tasseled Cap transformations, image segmentation and masking. These geospatial and spectral data were analyzed for the North Fork of the Navarro River, a sub-basin where spawning habitat for threatened coho salmon is effected by accelerated sediment delivery. Additionally, fieldwork verified the spatial position and dimensions of mass-wasting sites identified from aerial photography. A subset of 1066 identified sites was used for assessing feature extraction error from the AVIRIS imagery; the remaining sites were used for model verification. Augmenting these data within GIS, a multivariate analysis incorporated: proximity to salmon bearing streams; hillslope gradient; landslide position; and timber harvesting to identify patterns of disturbance. Preliminary results indicate that AVIRIS imagery can be segmented to identify exposed soil; furthermore, these identified areas are typically lower elevation, moderately steep hillslopes in constricted river valleys and correspond with mapped delivery sites. Hyperspectral data provide a means for the detection of sediment sources over large areas; however, the geometric and atmospheric corrections required to effectively process these data can be onerous. The current work is part of an interdisciplinary study at UC Davis intended to assist land use managers in development of TMDL guidelines in coastal watersheds in northern California. Our research in the North Fork indicates that similar approaches can be used for both inventorying and monitoring of disturbance patterns at the watershed scale.",December 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;salmon

Mass Wasting Identification in the Navarro River Watershed using Hyperspectral Imagery. ASCE Conference Proceedings. California and World Oceans, Santa Barbara, CA.","Several of northern California's coastal watersheds have been listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as requiring the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for non-point source pollution. One such case is the Navarro River watershed located in southern Mendocino County. The Navarro River was listed under the federal Clean Water Act Section 303(d) for the constituents of temperature and sediment. The Information Center for the Environment (ICE) at the University of California, Davis aided the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in the development of the TMDLs and continues to assist with ongoing work in the Navarro River watershed and other North Coast watersheds. During the summer of 2000, hyperspectral imagery was collected for the entire Navarro River watershed (∼820 km2) using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) administered by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration. This imagery covers the spectral wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm with spectral sampling of 10 nm, 224 contiguous channels, and a spatial resolution of 5 meters. Potential mass wasting sites were extracted from the AVIRIS imagery using various image processing techniques, such as the Tasseled Cap transformation, image segmentation and masking. Spectral unmixing algorithms were employed for mixed pixels (vegetation and soil) to determine the percentage of each material per pixel. Augmenting these data within a Geographic Information System (GIS), a digital elevation model was used to determine proximity to stream systems and hillslope position. This study focused on features in one sub-watershed, predominately on private timber lands: the North Fork of the Navarro River. The AVIRIS data analyzed for this area is of particular interest because it is one of the few sub-watersheds of the Navarro River complex that provides suitable spawning habitat for threatened coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Additionally, substantial fieldwork was performed in this sub-watershed to verify the spatial position and dimensions of identified mass-wasting sites. Of these approximately 1100 manually mapped and digitized mass-wasting sites, one-half were used for assessing commission and omission errors of features extracted from the AVIRIS imagery. The other sites were used to assess the accuracy of the terrain-based model SHALSTAB, which predicts landslide potential. Hyperspectral data do provide a means for the inventorying and monitoring of sediment delivery sites over large areas; however, the geometric and atmospheric corrections required to effectively process these data can be onerous. The utilization of hyperspectral imagery for watershed analysis is novel and holds great promise for future TMDL assessments, but it is not without limitations. The sheer volume of data, over 300 Gigabytes for the Navarro River watershed alone, can be overwhelming to an ill-equipped processing laboratory. Furthermore, comprehensive fieldwork is necessary for more advanced applications of spectral separability and identification. As hyperspectral data are incorporated into future watershed research programs, many of these benefits and limitations will be addressed. Although the identification of mass-wasting features was performed post-hoc for the Navarro River watershed, our research indicates that similar approaches can be used for other watersheds for a variety of purposes with success.",October 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;pollution;salmon

Geographic Information System Support for Total Maximum Daily Load Analysis of the Mattole River Watershed, Humboldt County, California. ASCE Conference Proceedings, California and the World Ocean 2002. Santa Barbara, CA.","The Mattole River Watershed (Figure 1), Humboldt County, California, is listed on the Clean Water Act Section 303(d) list of impaired water bodies, for sediment and temperature. As required by this section and subsequent litigation, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (NCRWQCB) is under consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these constituents. Sediment and temperature are non-point source pollutants that impair the listed beneficial uses for the river, particularly cold water fisheries for endangered salmonid populations. The Information Center for the Environment (ICE), at the University of California, Davis, has developed analysis procedures for assisting the NCRWQCB in addressing the TMDLs in the Mattole Watershed. To address the sediment TMDL, roads and mass-wasting features were inventoried. The mass-wasting inventory identified all discreet and chronic sediment sources through the use of five sets of stereoscopic aerial photographs spanning five decades. The road inventory focused on contemporary features and was implemented in a similar manner. Current 1:24,000-scale GIS data served as the base for aerial photobased augmentation. To support the temperature TMDL, ICE developed GIS-based inputs for the Stream Segment Temperature Model (SSTEMP), such as location, distance upstream from the mouth, elevation, and average shade for each reach in the stream network. Riparian stream shade was calculated using RipTopo, a GIS-based stream shading model, which incorporated streamside vegetation and topography to calculate the amount of effective shade for a given stream reach.",February 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;hydrology;riparian

A Multi-Proxy Approach to Examining Land-Use Change Effects on Steelhead Trout and Coho Salmon in NW California. EOS Trans. AGU 82(20):B41B-06","Historically, juvenile and spawning adult steelhead trout and coho salmon were found in abundance in the Navarro Basin of NW California. However, the numbers of juvenile steelhead and spawning adults have declined greatly over the past 100 years, while coho salmon rearing and spawning is now limited to only one sub-drainage. Steelhead and coho population data taken by the DFG along with GIS images of recent land-use change are being used in conjunction with sediment core data to determine specific land-use effects on watershed geomorphology and in-stream habitat quality. The study uses historical information on land use, fish populations, and river flow along with a multi-proxy analysis of cores taken from the Navarro floodplain to reconstruct geomorphic effects of land-use change and includes geochemical, palynological, grain size, LOI, and radiocarbon analyses. An historical analysis of logging operations within the watershed indicates three periods of increased mill operations peaking in 1952 with 32 mills. Digitized aerials from 1936 show the distribution of land-uses, including large swaths of clear-cut land. When these data are combined with a 100-yr record of fish distribution and a 50 yr record of discharge, a timeline of cumulative impacts is available for comparing against the multi-proxy record. For example, results from geochemical analyses may indicate anthropogenic effects on watershed sediment transport. A spike in Hg concentration at a depth of ~5 m occurs in all cores and an increase in concentrations of Hg, Cu, Co, Ba, Cr, and Ni begins at 3 m in most. Geochemical ternary diagrams of different core locations and depths show that sediment depositing in the floodplain of sub-drainages differ from main stem sediment, indicating spatio-temporal changes in sediment source areas. A palynological investigation is being conducted which will provide data of changes in ecosystem structure through time and will aid estimates of recent sedimentation rates.",May 2001,pollution;floodplain;salmon

Climatic and spatial patterns of diversity in the serpentine plants of California.

To examine the relationship between diversity and the spatial structure of habitats, we studied large-scale patterns of diversity in the flora of serpentine in California. We used multiple linear regressions on geographical information system (GIS)-derived data for 85 subregions of the state to analyse the climatic and spatial correlates of plant species richness. The diversity of plants endemic to serpentine declined from north to south and from the coast inland, in association with decreasing rainfall; the same trends were seen in the total flora, but the trends were stronger in serpentine endemics. Diversity of serpentine endemics increased with the area of serpentine and decreased with the mean isolation of serpentine patches in a subregion. The diversity of endemics was not correlated with the number of serpentine patches or their mean perimeter-to-area ratio. We conclude that patchiness in this terrestrial habitat does not appear to promote diversity, even at the large spatial scale associated with speciation and endemism.",May 2000,GIS;biodiversity;serpentine

As such, the identification and restoration of riparian habitats in the Navarro River watershed is paramount to the continued survival of this coho salmon population. This study utilizes a modeling procedure to identify priority locations in the Navarro River watershed using a geographic information system (GIS). This riparian habitat modeling method was used to identify priority restoration sites in the Navarro River watershed. The modeling structure emphasizes a hydrological metric, wetness index, and several landuse – land cover parameters. This GIS based model of the Navarro River was used for selecting potential riparian restoration sites, and used to demonstrate the utility of the model for selection of potential salmonid habitat. The results of analyzing the similarity between two model runs, one emphasizing habitat potential and the other anthropogenic degradation, indicate that riverine–riparian habitats have been disproportionately affected. This effort is offered as a potential tool to aid resource managers and local stakeholders with a method in which to initiate protection of aquatic ecological systems and coho salmon habitat in particular.",February 1999,modeling;GIS;riparian;salmon

Improving Water Quality Reporting in California with the GeoWaterbody System. 1998 ESRI International User Conference Proceedings. San Diego, CA.","In California, water quality assessment information is currently reported via a FoxPro (DOS) system known as the WaterBody System (WBS). WBS does not have a spatial component, and therefore users typically enter information for large named water courses. Several states, including California, have developed links from WBS waterbodies to EPA River Reach File (RF3-alpha) features, spatially referencing WBS to an existing nationwide hydrography layer. This spatial referencing step, however, has typically occurred after local scientists and resource managers entered assessment information into the WBS. In order to improve water quality reporting, the University of California, Davis (UCD) Information Center for the Environment (ICE) has developed GeoWBS, a customized graphical user interface using ArcView and the Dialog Designer Extension that allows users entering water quality assessment information to better spatially define waterbodies. This system links the assessment information to RF3-alpha, permits direct SQL connectivity to the underlying WBS architecture, and helps standardize user input. Starting in 1998, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) scientists will be trained to use the system and will report their assessments on more spatially refined waterbodies. Consequently, the water quality assessment information reported to EPA will be more spatially precise, queriable through a graphical interface, and will likely result in improved water quality monitoring, reporting, and policy-setting.",February 1998,GIS;hydrology

Joint efforts from the USGS and U.S. EPA to produce a spatial base and attribute model, respectively, have resulted in an alpha release of the River Reach File, a national hydrographic standard (RF3-alpha).

This paper summarizes the key events, beginning in 1992, with the California Department of Fish and Game's GIS program, which have led to the revision and correction of over 60,000 RF3 records in cooperation with federal, state, University of California at Davis (UCD), and private entities. The detail in the revisions ranges from complete hydrograhic address enumeration in portions of the Eel River basin, to statewide reconciliation of USGS hydrographic names with the RF1 and RF2 names. Benefits in addition to the strong cooperative relationships identified include the enabling of Internet-based search and query capabilities by state-level programs such as the California Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES) and the California Rivers Assessment (CARA).
