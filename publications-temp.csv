Beta diversity and the scaledependence of the productivity-diversity relationship: a test in the Californian serpentine flora. Journal of Ecology 94:110-117","    The relationship of productivity to species diversity is usually positive at regional scales, but is often neutral, unimodal or negative at local spatial scales. Recent studies have pointed out that beta diversity, or among-locality and within-region variation in species composition, must therefore tend to increase with productivity. We tested for a positive relationship of productivity to beta diversity in herbaceous plants at 105 widely distributed sites on serpentine soil in California. We also asked whether any such pattern could be explained, as previously proposed, by increased environmental heterogeneity at higher levels of productivity. We found that one measure of beta diversity (the species dissimilarity between paired 500 m2 plots on adjacent north and south slopes) was positively related to productivity (as measured by the normalized difference vegetation index, a remotely sensed index). However, this effect was not strong enough to transform the neutral relationship of productivity with alpha (1 m2) diversity to a positive relationship of productivity with gamma (1000 m2) diversity. The positive effect of productivity on beta diversity was not related to increasing heterogeneity in coarse measures of vegetation structure (percentage cover of shade, litter, rocks, moss, bare soil, animal disturbance). We speculate that the effect may instead have a ‘top-down’ explanation: higher beta diversity may be caused by the positive influence of productivity on the size of the regional species pool. Our study illustrates the principle of a ‘scale transition’, in which an ecological pattern is qualitatively different at different spatial scales. Careful attention to scale-dependence may help narrow the search for mechanisms for such long-studied ecological puzzles as the latitudinal diversity gradient.",January 2006, biodiversity;productivity;serpentine

We analyzed the distribution of riparian plant diversity in California's Sacramento - San Joaquin Valley, focusing on patterns found at three spatial scales, to support present and future large river habitat restoration initiatives. We examined species richness and complementarity between sample units at the riverscape, inter-riverine, and intra-riverine scales. At the coarsest riverscape scale, spatial patterns of native riparian richness were driven by herbaceous species, while woody species were largely cosmopolitan. Riverscape riparian species richness centered over the California Bay-Delta region, forming a natural geographic ecotone between the two largest watersheds. Inter-riverine richness and turnover between six watershed study locations also indicated native riparian flora shifts mid-valley. Fine-scale, intra-riverine riparian floras from the Sacramento and Cosumnes River floodplains had spatial patterns among sites that relate to successional sequences. These fine-scale patterns suggest flood-induced disturbance is an important factor in promoting heterogeneous habitats and herbaceous species turnover. Our results are consistent with modern riverscape ecological theory; wherein natural disturbances initiate patterned structural diversity that in turn promote aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. If biodiversity is to be a goal of future ecosystem restoration efforts, these findings suggest that hydrological processes promoting diversity and distribution of native riparian herbaceous flora need more attention. Furthermore, to be effective, large ecosystem restoration efforts require multi-scale approaches to assess baseline patterns of distribution and to develop appropriate benchmarks.",January 2006,habitat-restoration;biodiversity;hydrology;floodplain;riparian

In this contribution, we provide a list of taxa having high affinity to ultramafic/serpentine substrates in California, and present information on rarity, geographic distribution, taxonomy, and lifeform. Of species endemic to California, 12.5% are restricted to ultramafic substrates. Most of these taxa come from a half-dozen plant families, and from only one or two genera within each family. The North Coast and Klamath Ranges support more serpentine endemics than the rest of the State combined. 15% of all plant taxa listed as threatened or endangered in California show some degree of association with ultramafic substrates.

Jones, California, to review a number of elements of the ongoing work performed by the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board, including their affiliates. The TAG members had the opportunity to review preliminary results from a macro-scale stream shade indexing model, RipTopo. This model, developed by UC Davis scientists and funded by the Regional Board, accounts for riparian and topographic shading conditions and is intended to support development of the temperature TMDL in the Scott River watershed. RipTopo used existing statewide vegetation data, augmented by existing riparian vegetation digitized from aerial photographs, to depict the current and potential height of streamside vegetation in the watershed. The TAG members who reviewed the model results expressed concern about the lack of site specificity when depicting potential vegetation height conditions in selected areas of the watershed, particularly in those areas, which currently lack forest cover. The members felt that the TMDL effort could be improved through additional scientific input and recognition of potential ecological and land-use constraints in selected reaches of the watershed. In response to these concerns, this report covers elements of 1) an extensive review of the technical, scientific, and historical literature relevant to potential riparian conditions in the Scott River watershed; and 2) the input from a combination of local expert stakeholders, agency scientists, and ecological scientists who reviewed in the field existing conditions in particular sub-watersheds. This report is intended as written findings from the supplementary review of the literature, and ecological conditions identified in the site visits, to be evaluated by the North Coast Regional Control Board as part of the temperature TMDL for the Scott River.",June 2005,modeling;management;riparian

To this end, we model net primary productivity (NPP) c. 1750 AD and at present (1982–1999) and map native and exotic vascular plant richness for 230 subecoregions. NPP has increased up to 105% in semi-arid areas and decreased up to 48% in coastal urbanized areas. Exotic invasions have increased local species diversity up to 15%. Human activities have reinforced historical gradients in species richness but reduced the spatial heterogeneity of NPP. Structural equation modelling suggests that, prior to European settlement, NPP and richness were primarily controlled by precipitation and other abiotic variables, with NPP mediating richness. Abiotic variables remain the strongest predictors of present NPP and richness, but intermodel comparisons indicate a significant anthropogenic impact upon statewide distributions of NPP and richness. Exotic and native species each positively correlate to NPP after controlling for other variables, which may help explain recent reports of positively associated native and exotic richness.",February 2005, biodiversity;invasive-species;productivity

Fish invasions in California Watersheds: testing hypotheses using landscape patterns. Ecological Applications 14(5), pp. 1507–1525","An important goal of invasion biology is to identify physical and environmental characteristics that may make a region particularly receptive to invasions. The inland waters of California (USA) are highly invaded, particularly by fishes, although there is wide variation in numbers of nonnative fishes across the state's watersheds. Here we examine patterns of fish invasions in California watersheds and their associations with natural environmental characteristics, native fish diversity, and various measures of human habitat disturbance. Our analysis is based on an extensive data set on the distribution of freshwater fishes across California's watersheds and on GIS land-use coverages for the entire state. We used canonical correspondence analysis to examine associations between environmental characteristics and the distributions of both native and nonnative fish species. We then employed an information-theoretic model-selection approach to rank hypothesized models derived from the fish invasion literature with regard to how well they predicted numbers of nonnative fishes in California watersheds. Our results indicate that pervasive, anthropogenic, landscape-level changes (particularly the extent of urban development, small-scale water diversions, aqueducts, and agriculture) influenced spatial patterns of invasion. In addition, we find that deliberately stocked fishes have different habitat associations, including a strong association with the presence of dams, than other introduced fishes. In our analysis, watersheds with the most native species also contain the most nonnative species. We find no evidence that existing watershed protection helps to prevent fish invasions in California, but we suggest that restoration of natural hydrologic processes may reduce invasion impacts.",October 2004,modeling;GIS;invasive-species

AGU, 83(47): B21A-0710.","Analysis of hyperspectral data is a particularly novel approach to investigation of the relation between anthropogenic and natural disturbances, geomorphic responses, and ecosystem patterns at the watershed scale. During July 2000, hyperspectral imagery was collected for the Navarro basin (820km2) using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). This NASA sensor covers the spectral wavelength range from 400nm - 2500nm, with spectral sampling of 10nm in 224 contiguous channels, and spatial resolution of 5m. These data are being analyzed for a variety of applications; however, their use for detecting patterns of disturbance within the watershed is intriguing, especially for the identification and delineation of mass wasting sites that deliver sediment to salmon bearing streams. Mass wasting sites were extracted from AVIRIS imagery using image processing techniques such as Minimum Noise Fraction and Tasseled Cap transformations, image segmentation and masking. These geospatial and spectral data were analyzed for the North Fork of the Navarro River, a sub-basin where spawning habitat for threatened coho salmon is effected by accelerated sediment delivery. Additionally, fieldwork verified the spatial position and dimensions of mass-wasting sites identified from aerial photography. A subset of 1066 identified sites was used for assessing feature extraction error from the AVIRIS imagery; the remaining sites were used for model verification. Augmenting these data within GIS, a multivariate analysis incorporated: proximity to salmon bearing streams; hillslope gradient; landslide position; and timber harvesting to identify patterns of disturbance. Preliminary results indicate that AVIRIS imagery can be segmented to identify exposed soil; furthermore, these identified areas are typically lower elevation, moderately steep hillslopes in constricted river valleys and correspond with mapped delivery sites. Hyperspectral data provide a means for the detection of sediment sources over large areas; however, the geometric and atmospheric corrections required to effectively process these data can be onerous. The current work is part of an interdisciplinary study at UC Davis intended to assist land use managers in development of TMDL guidelines in coastal watersheds in northern California. Our research in the North Fork indicates that similar approaches can be used for both inventorying and monitoring of disturbance patterns at the watershed scale.",December 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;salmon

Mass Wasting Identification in the Navarro River Watershed using Hyperspectral Imagery. ASCE Conference Proceedings. California and World Oceans, Santa Barbara, CA.","Several of northern California's coastal watersheds have been listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as requiring the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for non-point source pollution. One such case is the Navarro River watershed located in southern Mendocino County. The Navarro River was listed under the federal Clean Water Act Section 303(d) for the constituents of temperature and sediment. The Information Center for the Environment (ICE) at the University of California, Davis aided the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board in the development of the TMDLs and continues to assist with ongoing work in the Navarro River watershed and other North Coast watersheds. During the summer of 2000, hyperspectral imagery was collected for the entire Navarro River watershed (∼820 km2) using the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) administered by the National Aeronautic and Space Administration. This imagery covers the spectral wavelength range from 400 to 2500 nm with spectral sampling of 10 nm, 224 contiguous channels, and a spatial resolution of 5 meters. Potential mass wasting sites were extracted from the AVIRIS imagery using various image processing techniques, such as the Tasseled Cap transformation, image segmentation and masking. Spectral unmixing algorithms were employed for mixed pixels (vegetation and soil) to determine the percentage of each material per pixel. Augmenting these data within a Geographic Information System (GIS), a digital elevation model was used to determine proximity to stream systems and hillslope position. This study focused on features in one sub-watershed, predominately on private timber lands: the North Fork of the Navarro River. The AVIRIS data analyzed for this area is of particular interest because it is one of the few sub-watersheds of the Navarro River complex that provides suitable spawning habitat for threatened coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). Additionally, substantial fieldwork was performed in this sub-watershed to verify the spatial position and dimensions of identified mass-wasting sites. Of these approximately 1100 manually mapped and digitized mass-wasting sites, one-half were used for assessing commission and omission errors of features extracted from the AVIRIS imagery. The other sites were used to assess the accuracy of the terrain-based model SHALSTAB, which predicts landslide potential. Hyperspectral data do provide a means for the inventorying and monitoring of sediment delivery sites over large areas; however, the geometric and atmospheric corrections required to effectively process these data can be onerous. The utilization of hyperspectral imagery for watershed analysis is novel and holds great promise for future TMDL assessments, but it is not without limitations. The sheer volume of data, over 300 Gigabytes for the Navarro River watershed alone, can be overwhelming to an ill-equipped processing laboratory. Furthermore, comprehensive fieldwork is necessary for more advanced applications of spectral separability and identification. As hyperspectral data are incorporated into future watershed research programs, many of these benefits and limitations will be addressed. Although the identification of mass-wasting features was performed post-hoc for the Navarro River watershed, our research indicates that similar approaches can be used for other watersheds for a variety of purposes with success.",October 2002,remote-sensing;GIS;pollution;salmon

As required by this section and subsequent litigation, the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board (NCRWQCB) is under consent decree with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) for these constituents. Sediment and temperature are non-point source pollutants that impair the listed beneficial uses for the river, particularly cold water fisheries for endangered salmonid populations. The Information Center for the Environment (ICE), at the University of California, Davis, has developed analysis procedures for assisting the NCRWQCB in addressing the TMDLs in the Mattole Watershed. To address the sediment TMDL, roads and mass-wasting features were inventoried. The mass-wasting inventory identified all discreet and chronic sediment sources through the use of five sets of stereoscopic aerial photographs spanning five decades. The road inventory focused on contemporary features and was implemented in a similar manner. Current 1:24,000-scale GIS data served as the base for aerial photobased augmentation. To support the temperature TMDL, ICE developed GIS-based inputs for the Stream Segment Temperature Model (SSTEMP), such as location, distance upstream from the mouth, elevation, and average shade for each reach in the stream network.

However, the numbers of juvenile steelhead and spawning adults have declined greatly over the past 100 years, while coho salmon rearing and spawning is now limited to only one sub-drainage. Steelhead and coho population data taken by the DFG along with GIS images of recent land-use change are being used in conjunction with sediment core data to determine specific land-use effects on watershed geomorphology and in-stream habitat quality. The study uses historical information on land use, fish populations, and river flow along with a multi-proxy analysis of cores taken from the Navarro floodplain to reconstruct geomorphic effects of land-use change and includes geochemical, palynological, grain size, LOI, and radiocarbon analyses. An historical analysis of logging operations within the watershed indicates three periods of increased mill operations peaking in 1952 with 32 mills. Digitized aerials from 1936 show the distribution of land-uses, including large swaths of clear-cut land. When these data are combined with a 100-yr record of fish distribution and a 50 yr record of discharge, a timeline of cumulative impacts is available for comparing against the multi-proxy record. For example, results from geochemical analyses may indicate anthropogenic effects on watershed sediment transport. A spike in Hg concentration at a depth of ~5 m occurs in all cores and an increase in concentrations of Hg, Cu, Co, Ba, Cr, and Ni begins at 3 m in most. Geochemical ternary diagrams of different core locations and depths show that sediment depositing in the floodplain of sub-drainages differ from main stem sediment, indicating spatio-temporal changes in sediment source areas. A palynological investigation is being conducted which will provide data of changes in ecosystem structure through time and will aid estimates of recent sedimentation rates.",May 2001,pollution;floodplain;salmon

We used multiple linear regressions on geographical information system (GIS)-derived data for 85 subregions of the state to analyse the climatic and spatial correlates of plant species richness. The diversity of plants endemic to serpentine declined from north to south and from the coast inland, in association with decreasing rainfall; the same trends were seen in the total flora, but the trends were stronger in serpentine endemics. Diversity of serpentine endemics increased with the area of serpentine and decreased with the mean isolation of serpentine patches in a subregion. The diversity of endemics was not correlated with the number of serpentine patches or their mean perimeter-to-area ratio.

The results of analyzing the similarity between two model runs, one emphasizing habitat potential and the other anthropogenic degradation, indicate that riverine–riparian habitats have been disproportionately affected. This effort is offered as a potential tool to aid resource managers and local stakeholders with a method in which to initiate protection of aquatic ecological systems and coho salmon habitat in particular.",February 1999,modeling;GIS;riparian;salmon

Improving Water Quality Reporting in California with the GeoWaterbody System. 1998 ESRI International User Conference Proceedings. San Diego, CA.","In California, water quality assessment information is currently reported via a FoxPro (DOS) system known as the WaterBody System (WBS). WBS does not have a spatial component, and therefore users typically enter information for large named water courses. Several states, including California, have developed links from WBS waterbodies to EPA River Reach File (RF3-alpha) features, spatially referencing WBS to an existing nationwide hydrography layer. This spatial referencing step, however, has typically occurred after local scientists and resource managers entered assessment information into the WBS. In order to improve water quality reporting, the University of California, Davis (UCD) Information Center for the Environment (ICE) has developed GeoWBS, a customized graphical user interface using ArcView and the Dialog Designer Extension that allows users entering water quality assessment information to better spatially define waterbodies. This system links the assessment information to RF3-alpha, permits direct SQL connectivity to the underlying WBS architecture, and helps standardize user input. Starting in 1998, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) scientists will be trained to use the system and will report their assessments on more spatially refined waterbodies. Consequently, the water quality assessment information reported to EPA will be more spatially precise, queriable through a graphical interface, and will likely result in improved water quality monitoring, reporting, and policy-setting.",February 1998,GIS;hydrology

California's Experience with the River Reach File. 1997 ESRI International User Conference Proceedings. San Diego, CA.","Organized hydrographic information is vital to the success of environmental planning and management. Joint efforts from the USGS and U.S. EPA to produce a spatial base and attribute model, respectively, have resulted in an alpha release of the River Reach File, a national hydrographic standard (RF3-alpha). In California, this represents over 200,000 records of hydrographic features maintained and distributed by the state's Teale GIS Technology Center in ARC/INFO format for use by public agencies and the private sector. This paper summarizes the key events, beginning in 1992, with the California Department of Fish and Game's GIS program, which have led to the revision and correction of over 60,000 RF3 records in cooperation with federal, state, University of California at Davis (UCD), and private entities. The detail in the revisions ranges from complete hydrograhic address enumeration in portions of the Eel River basin, to statewide reconciliation of USGS hydrographic names with the RF1 and RF2 names. Benefits in addition to the strong cooperative relationships identified include the enabling of Internet-based search and query capabilities by state-level programs such as the California Environmental Resources Evaluation System (CERES) and the California Rivers Assessment (CARA). Future development of RF3 will focus on empowering individuals and watershed interest groups with a robust spatial and attribute standard for hydrographic information of all types, extents, and applications.",February 1997,GIS;hydrology
